# Building Escape

This is my first contact with Unreal Engine 4 while doing the course found at: https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/learn/v4/overview
It is my second course after the unity course that I did before this one. I decided to learn basics of both platforms to decide 
In which one I would like to create my games as a hobby and for learning purposes.

This is the most simple game that I have created in Unreal Engine, contains a room from which you are supposed to escape.
